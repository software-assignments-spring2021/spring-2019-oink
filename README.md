# Oink: A Mobile Piggy Bank

Bill splitters are useful for calculating bills and tips when you go out with friends, but most just calculate the bill without knowing anything about it. Unfortunately, current bill splitters leave many desirable questions unanswered. For example:

- What if you go out with the same group of friends? 
- What if you always split utility bills with your roommates? 
- What if the bills aren't split evenly? What if you have a recurring bill? 

Oink provides the best (and only) solution to these questions.

## Who is it for?

Oink is for anyone who goes out with friends, has roommates, or just needs to split a bill.
This bill splitter will both calculate how you should split a bill, but will also keep track of friends that you usually split with. 

**Have roommates or a weekend brunch crew?** You can create a group to automatically split with everyone in one click.
**Have a roommate that constantly leaves lights or the AC on?** When splitting a bill you can add weights for certain people so that one roommate pays more.

You can set a deadline for a bill payment and add reminders for any recurring bills so that they're paid on time.

If you don't like to split bills but instead prefer to switch who pays each time you go out, you can track how much each person has spent, ensuring
that everyone spends an equal amount.

## A Brief History of Oink

Like anyone else, we've spent far too much time on meals, booking reservations, etc. discussing how exactly to split a bill with friends. It's a common problem, but it really shouldn't be. There's no reason why groups of people should spend several minutes manually calculating percentages and figures when it could all be done for them with the press of a button. With Oink, we wanted to put an end to this problem and create something we could actually see ourselves using on a daily basis!
